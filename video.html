        <h1>Nature knows the way when the roads get rough, when the skies grow dark,   <span class="bigger-text">Designing within Nature</span> whenever the world spins fast — nature knows the way. Through rustling leaves and roaring rivers, through still mornings and thunder nights, nature knows the way. When the mind is cluttered, when the heart is heavy, when the noise is too loud — nature whispers: breathe. Because nature knows the way.
          It doesn’t rush. It doesn’t boast. It doesn’t panic. It flows, it grows, it glows. Because nature knows the way. The roots reach down while the branches stretch high. The mountains stand still while the winds fly by. The wolves run wild, the oceans rise bold, and still — nature knows the way.
            Step outside. Listen close. Smell the rain. Feel the sun. Trust the earth. Nature knows the way.
            In chaos, in calm, in endings, in birth — in every corner of this breathing earth — nature knows the way. Over time, under pressure, it keeps moving forward, never getting lost. Because nature, always and forever, knows the way. When the day feels too long, when the journey feels endless, nature knows the way. It reminds us that even the tallest mountain began with a single step, and every river finds its path through the stones. Even in the stillness, even in the storm, nature continues, unwavering. It teaches us to trust the rhythm of the world — to breathe deeply, to move with purpose, and to remember that no matter the twists, the turns, or the storms — nature knows the way. It guides us through the seasons, with the same gentle persistence that has been passed down since the dawn of time. And as the stars shine above us, we are reminded: nature knows the way. So, when the world feels heavy and the journey feels too much, remember to pause, listen, and trust. Nature, in its infinite wisdom, will always show us the way.
